Place to put eventual compile rules?

Compile rules have:

- Transformer: That can transform a tree
- Tags: To order the rule to type of trees it matches, which flags, state of transform and other meta data, comments, etc...
- Name: Name of the transform

- Tree reference(s) and other relevant documentation or references: To aid debugging

Rules may actually later stored in decentralized databases
